  abstract = {Recent empirical studies have demonstrated significant spatial variation in the population biology of coral reef fish. The scales at which this variation occurs often depend on the species and processes that are examined. Most research on coral reef fish population biology has focused on relatively small, site-attached species and results from such research often indicate variations in population biology at localised spatial scales, such as 10's to 100's or 1000's of meters. There have been fewer studies of large reef fish species and, consequently, little is known of the spatial patterns in population biology of large reef fish. Large reef fish are generally thought to be more mobile and have larger home ranges than small reef fish species. Therefore, the spatial scales that define intermixed populations of large reef fish may differ from those at which small reef fish vary. Furthermore, large reef fish species are often the targets for commercial and recreational fisheries. Information on the spatial patterns in population biology of harvested species will be of particular importance for fisheries management, as population responses to fishing pressure and different management strategies will vary among populations with different dynamics. Within this context, the broad objectives of this thesis were to:

1) Estimate a number of reproductive parameters, including spawning season, maturity schedules and size and age at sex change for the red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) and compare the parameters between the northern and southern areas of the distribution of L. miniatus on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR);

2) Estimate rates of growth and mortality for L. miniatus and compare these parameters within and among three regions of the GBR over a temporal scale of five years; and

3) Explore the potential for large-scale movement of post-settlement L. miniatus to explain the observed spatial patterns in population age structures. Estimates of population parameters for these objectives required reliable estimates of age. Accordingly, age estimates of L. miniatus were first validated using marginal increment analysis (MIA) and captive rearing of chemically tagged fish. The MIA was achieved by obtaining monthly samples of L. miniatus from commercial line fishing vessels from the northern and southern areas of the GBR. Fish that were chemically tagged and reared in an aquarium were also collected from a commercial fishing vessel. Opaque increments in the otoliths of L. miniatus were found to be deposited on an annual basis, but the timing of formation varied slightly between years and areas.

Reproductive parameters (Objective 1) were derived from the monthly samples collected from the commercial fleet. A peak spawning season was observed between July and October in both the northern and southern areas of the distribution of L. miniatus on the GBR. The proportion of spawning females, however, was greater in the northern area than in the southern area. The size at which L. miniatus changed sex from female to male was significantly larger in the southern area, but there were no spatial differences in the age at sex change. The size and age at maturity were estimated to be 180 mm FL and 1.2 years respectively, but data were insufficient to allow spatial comparisons of these parameters. 

Spatial patterns in growth and mortality of L. miniatus (Objective 2) were estimated from annual samples of populations of L. miniatus from four reefs within three regions of the GBR (Townsville, Mackay and Storm Cay) over a period of five years. Growth rates were found to vary among years but this variation was consistent among regions and reefs. Mortality rates were consistent among cohorts within each region and reef. Rates of growth and mortality were relatively similar at the spatial scale of individual reefs within regions but differed significantly among regions. This regional variation was consistent over years. The Townsville (northern-most) region was characterised by the smallest maximum size, and lowest rates of mortality. In contrast, the Mackay region was characterised by the largest maximum size, and highest rates of mortality. Rates of growth and mortality for the Storm Cay (southern-most) region were intermediate between the other two regions.

The potential for migration of L. miniatus to contribute to the observed patterns in population parameters (Objective 3) was explored by developing an age structured model for L. miniatus populations from the Townsville, Mackay and Storm Cay regions of the GBR, using the empirical data collected from the annual regional samples. Model age structures were compared with observed age structures to determine the net movement that would be required to explain the significant regional variations in age structure. The model predicted significant immigration to the Townsville region of fish aged from three to 10 years and significant emigration of fish aged three and four years from the Mackay region. Predicted net movement in the Storm Cay region was negligible, although immigration of a small number of seven year old fish was predicted under some model scenarios. A number of hypotheses that might explain the model results are discussed. The results from this thesis highlight the need to determine the spatial scales at which all demographic processes operate, including movement, to obtain reliable estimates of population structure and provide the most useful information with which to optimise harvest strategies for reef fish.},

technique with traps, and hook-and-line fishing, movements of serranids, lutjanids and lethrinids were monitored at 2 experimental and 2 control sites. Experimental sites were bisected by reserve boundaries into \OE{}zones$^1$ open and closed to fishing.
Control sites were protected from fishing, with an arbitrary boundary creating 2 equal zones. Between 1997 and 1999, 1374 individuals were externally tagged, and during 1999 densities were manipulated twice. Underwater visual census (UVC) surveys revealed
pre-manipulation density gradients between zones that were weak at real boundaries, and stronger at the arbitrary control boundaries. Movements were highly localized, with over 60\% of recaptures being made within the 50 x30 m block of initial capture.
The mean distances moved differed between the 3 species with the highest recapture rates: Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae) moved distances $>$100 m, Lutjanus carponotatus (Lutjanidae) occasionally moved over 50 m, while Cephalopholis
cyanostigma (Serranidae) was predominantly caught within the block of initial capture. Movements across real or control boundaries were rare. Twice in 1999, fish densities in zones open to fishing at the experimental sites were reduced by spearfishing
(by 61 to 64\% and 57 to 83\%, respectively). UVC revealed density gradients at the experimental boundaries and no changes at non-manipulated control sites. There was no evidence of experimentally induced directional movements, using traps or hook-and-line
sampling; however, 3 species (C. cyanostigma, L. carponotatus, L. quinquelineatus) did show a propensity for increased movements. Detection of spillover requires powerful sampling designs incorporating strong density gradients
across large numbers of reserve boundaries.},

  abstract = {Spatial variation in demographic parameters of the red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) was examined among 12 coral reefs in three geographic regions (Townsville, Mackay, and Storm Cay) spanning over 3$^\circ$ of latitude of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Estimates of demographic parameters were based on age estimates from counts of annuli
in whole otoliths because there was no significant difference in age estimates between whole and sectioned otoliths. There were significant regional differences in age structures, rates of somatic and otolith growth, and total mortality. The Townsville region was characterized
by the greatest proportion of older fish, the smallest maximum size, and the lowest rates of otolith growth and
total mortality. In contrast the Mackay region was characterized by the highest proportion of younger fish, the largest maximum size, and the highest rates of otolith growth and total mortality. Demographic parameters for the Storm Cay region were intermediate between the other two regions. Historic differences in fishing pressure and regional differences in productivity are two alternative hypotheses given to explain the regional patterns in demographic parameters. All demographic parameters were similar among the four reefs within each region. Thus, subpopulations with relatively homogeneous demographic parameters occurred on scales of reef clusters. Previous studies, by contrast, have found substantial between-reef variation in demographic parameters within regions. Thus spatial variation in demographic parameters for L. miniatus may differ from what is assumed typical for a coral-reef
fish metapopulation.},

  abstract = {Patterns of movement and space utilization by fishes are becoming increasingly important to the understanding of population dynamics, community structure and spatial population models. Despite this, information regarding patterns of movement is rare for
fishes. The aim of this study was to determine home ranges and basic temporal patterns of space use of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a species of major fishing importance on coral reefs. Thirty-nine individual P. leopardus (size
range: 37.6 to 67.5 cm FL) were tracked successfully via ultrasonic telemetry between 1993 and 1995. Eight of these were tracked during 2 subsequent field trips, resulting in 47 separate tracking sessions, comprising a total of 2024 fish-tracking days.
Average minimum area polygon home ranges of P. leopardus differed between fish from continuous fringing reefs [10458.4 m2 $\pm$ 962.3 (SE)] and isolated patch reefs [18796.9 m2 $\pm$ 3188.8 (SE)], and were due to differences in widths
of home ranges, with fringing reef home ranges being narrower than patch reef ones. Lengths of home ranges did not differ between reef types. Home ranges did not differ between male and female fish, and were stable within and between each tracking session
(maximum 202 d between sessions). P. leopardus were diurnally active, regularly using a small number of physical locations (3 or 4) within their home ranges. Mean daily distance moved within home ranges was 192.2 m $\pm$ 5.09 (SE), with the maximum
being 1121.8 m. Patterns of space use were relatively consistent throughout the day. Location fidelity was very high at night, and reflected limited movements by the fish. The present data document for the first time the home range of a large coral reef
serranid, and illustrate its preference for a small number of locations within a larger home range area. Ultrasonic telemetry is the most suitable tool for evaluation of home ranges and movements of large reef fishes. This has implications for the
acquisition of data required for the evaluation of marine reserves as fisheries management tools for coral reefs.},

  abstract = {A frequent expectation of the use of marine reserves in management of coral reef fisheries is maintenance or enhancement of yields to areas adjacent to reserves by adult (post-settlement) movements from reserve to fished areas (the so-called 'spillover
effect'). Demonstration of this effect has been rare. This paper reports on some circumstantial evidence derived from underwater visual census monitoring of densities of large predatory coral reef fish [Serranidae (Epinephelinae), Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae
and Carangidae as a group] inside and adjacent to a small marine reserve at Apo Island in the central Philippines over a 10 yr period (1983 to 1993). The marine reserve (sanctuary) at Apo Island was established in 1982 and was protected from fishing for
the duration of the study. The non-reserve area was open to fishing by up to 200 municipal fishers using traditional fishing gear (bamboo traps, hooks and lines, gill nets and spears). Significant positive correlations of both mean density and species
richness of large predatory fish with duration of reserve protection (from 1 to 11 yr) were observed in both the reserve and non-reserve areas surveyed. The minimum distance from the boundary of the reserve to the non-reserve area surveyed was 200 m.
During the first 8 yr of reserve protection combined, the density of large predatory fish at distances 200 to 300, 300 to 400 and 400 to 500 m from the reserve boundary did not differ significantly from an even distribution (chi-squared test, p $>$ 0.05).
During the period of 9 to 11 yr of protection combined, there was a significantly higher density of these fish in the area closest to the reserve (i.e. in the 200 to 300 m area, chi-squared test, p $<$ 0.05). This visual census data is consistent with a
proposed model of adult fish export from the reserve to the non-reserve areas. Along with interview data collected in 1986 and 1992 that showed that fishers were unanimous that their yields had increased since the reserve was implemented, this study
provides evidence for export of adult fish from reserve to fished areas.},

  title = {Determinants of Home Range and Territory Size in Coral Reef Fishes},
  copyright = {open},
  abstract = {Most animals limit their daily movements to a familiar space known as a home range. However, some animals may also defend part or all of the home range, with the defended portion termed a territory. The twin concepts of home range and territory define an individual's use of space. The determinants of home range and territory size are known to be complex. Body size, diet and food availability can set the minimum area required to meet metabolic demands, for both home ranges and territories. However, population density and interactions with other species may constrain the size of defended areas. Coral reef fishes typically have relatively small home ranges and are also considered to be highly territorial. However, patterns in the use of space are highly variable and the differing determinants of home range and territory size are poorly understood. An understanding of the ecological factors that govern an individual's use of space is critical, not only to understanding the evolution of behaviour, but also provide information on how best to manage species in changing environments.

The overall aim of this thesis was to increase our empirical and theoretical understanding of the determinants of home range and territory size in coral reef fishes. I applied both comparative and experimental approaches to generate and test hypotheses concerning a range of factors affecting both home range and territory size in reef fishes. In the comparative studies (Chapters 2 and 3), the goal was to extend the taxonomic data-base to explore the correlates between both home range and territory size, and the factors theory predicts to be important, including body size and trophic status. In addition, I focussed on factors that may specifically apply to coral reef environments such as depth, coral cover and habitat complexity. The experimental studies focussed on the potential roles of food availability and local population density as determinants of territory size in an herbivorous damselfish (Chapter 4) and butterflyfishes (Chapter 5).

In Chapter 2, I compared home ranges sizes within and among 24 species from 10 commonly present families of coral reef fishes, representing different body sizes, trophic groups and local habitats at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). Home range sizes varied from 0.5 m$^2$ in the territorial damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus to 350 m$^2$ in the butterflyfish Chaetodon melannotus, with an overall average of approximately 62 m$^2$. Home range sizes differed among the families studied, being highest in the butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae), emperors (Lethrinidae) and rabbitfishes (Siganidae), and lowest in the damselfishes (Pomacentridae). This appeared to reflect both trophic position (with home ranges largest in corallivores, macro-carnivores and roving herbivores, and smallest in planktivores), and body size (with home ranges larger for typically larger species). Within species, home ranges were commonly found to increase with body size and proximity to the substratum and to decrease with topographic complexity. However, there were no general rules and much of the variation in home range size among species and individuals was unexplained. The results confirm that home range sizes of reef fishes are an order of magnitude smaller than terrestrial vertebrates of similar size. The small home ranges of most reef fishes closely associated with complex reef habitats makes them particularly sensitive to habitat degradation, as they are likely to have limited ability to relocate following local disturbances.

The next chapter (Chapter 3) explored the determinants of homing and territorial behaviour in damselfish (family Pomacentridae), a group recognized for having small home ranges, strong territoriality and a close association with coral reef habitats. This comparative behavioural study examines the correlates of variation in home range and territory size in nine different damselfish species that are common at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef), and that encompass a range of trophic and social systems. All species exhibited relatively small home ranges, ranging from an average of only approximately 0.2 m$^2$ for the coral-associated Chromis viridis to 6.5 m$^2$ for the omnivorous Abudefduf sexfasciatus. All species except two small schooling planktivores exhibited some level of aggressive defence of core areas in their home range, but the proportion of the home range defended varied among species. Farming herbivorous species and A. sexfasciatus defended the largest proportion of their home range, while planktivores generally had the smallest home ranges and were the least aggressive. Both home range and territory sizes were weakly correlated with body size and average distance above the substratum, both within and among species. These results confirm that damselfishes commonly defend core areas within their home ranges.

Population density and food availability are two key ecological factors known to influence the size of defended areas in territorial animals. Territories are predicted to be smaller at high population densities and with increasing food availability. However, these two factors potentially interact, with high population densities constraining territories and preventing them from expanding when food declines, which may lead to territory abandonment. The aim of Chapter 4 was to examine the correlates of natural variation in territory size in low and high density populations of the herbivorous damselfish Dischistodus melanotus at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). The roles of food availability were then tested by experimentally decreasing and increasing food levels in the low-density population (experiment one) and high density populations (experiment two). In experiment two, the effects of local density were tested by experimentally removing conspecific neighbours. Average territory size was two times larger in low-density populations, compared with high-density populations. Unexpectedly, there was no significant change in territory size in response to experimental increases or decreases in food in the low-density population, but several individuals abandoned territories when food was decreased. Also unexpectedly, individuals in the high-density population did not expand territories when neighbours were removed, but many relocated to occupy new territories. Individuals showed a significant increase in territory size when food was increased, both when neighbours were removed and in the controls. These results suggest that both population density and food availability do influence territory size, but the effects are context specific and do not conform to common theoretical predictions.

Chapter 5 focussed on specialised coral-feeding butterflyfishes (family Chaetodontidae). It examined whether patterns of home range use and territorial behaviour relate to coral cover, and experimentally investigated whether individuals expand home range size when coral cover is reduced. Behavioural observations on five species showed that individuals concentrate activity in multiple core areas within their home ranges, which between 80 and 380 m$^2$. Core areas appeared to be determined by the presence of preferred coral species. When access to core areas was experimentally reduced for two species by placing cages over the corals in core areas within home ranges, two different patterns were observed. A specialised corallivore (Chaetodon lunulatus) tended to show no response or abandon home ranges, while a more generalised coral-feeder (C. auriga) expanded its home range by over 60\%. For both species, individual variation in home range size was positively correlated with body size and rugosity, and negatively correlated with coral cover. These results suggest that the localised availability of corals is critical in determining the location and size of butterflyfish home ranges and territories, which may explain the dramatic population consequences of reef degradation.

Overall, this study has shown that the spatial behaviour of coral reef fishes, including both home range and territorial behaviour is complex, and influenced by a range of factors, most notably body size, degree of association with benthic substrata, reef rugosity, population density and food availability. It confirms the general perception that most small reef fish have small home ranges, relative to similar-size terrestrial animals. It confirms that territorial behaviour is commonly associated with small home range size in coral reef damselfishes. These spatial behaviours suggest that most small reef fishes will be amenable to management inside relatively small marine protected areas. However, additional actions to protection reef health will be essential to maintain natural patterns in the behavioural ecology of this diverse group of vertebrates.},

Obtaining movement data for many species by means of traditional tagging methods can be difficult because of high tagging-induced mortality and low recapture rates. We used an age-structured population dynamics model parameterised using data from different regions to explore potential movement patterns for the red throat emperor Lethrinus miniatus, an exploited coral reef fish species for which traditional tagging studies have been unsuccessful. The model used a Gaussian function to describe the proportion of fish of a given age moving to or from 1 of 3 regions (Townsville, Mackay and Storm Cay) of the Great Barrier Reef. The model was fitted with and without movement to empirical age frequency data from each region over a 5 yr period (1995 to 1999). Including movement in the model led to significantly better fits to the data and revealed discrete movement patterns within each region. The model predicted net immigration to the Townsville region and net emigration from the Mackay and Storm Cay regions. We present alternative hypotheses about migration patterns of L. miniatus and highlight the importance of determining the scales at which movement in larger, exploited coral reef fishes occurs.},
